        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <h4>   1. To provide remote-access to simulation-based Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering.
            
        <h4>   2. To enthuse students to conduct experiments by arousing their curiosity. This would help them in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation.</h4>
            
        <h4>   3. To provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where the students/ teachers can avail the various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation.</h4>
